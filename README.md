# After The Storm

There will always be storms in life.

That doesn't mean you have to go through them alone.

Recent studies have shown that the percentage of U.S. teens and young adults reporting mental distress, depression and suicidal thoughts and actions have risen significantly over the past decade

After the Storm is a startup app idea that would seek to connect young-adults going through challenges in their lives with other young-adults or people that have been through similar storms to help guide them through.
